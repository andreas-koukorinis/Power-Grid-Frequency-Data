# Power-Grid-Frequency-Data
Power-grid frequency data from around the world, cleaned and processed for research usage

The data is collected from local open sources and pre-processed to remove dead recordings, spikes, and other naturally assumed bad measurements.

The data is sorted by country providing the data. Keep in mind that different countries may belong to the same power-grid system

The comma-separated values (csv) and the text (txt) files are compressed (zip). Included are also the numpy savez files (npz) for easy read on python.

# European Grids
## Germany
These recordings are obtained from the TransNet BW from:
